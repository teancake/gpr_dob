% gpr_dob - Gaussian process regression with derivative observations.
%
% This program is modified upon the gpr function in the GPML toolbox. The
% original declaration is as follows.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% gpr - Gaussian process regression, with a named covariance function. Two
% modes are possible: training and prediction: if no test data are given, the
% function returns minus the log likelihood and its partial derivatives with
% respect to the hyperparameters; this mode is used to fit the hyperparameters.
% If test data are given, then (marginal) Gaussian predictions are computed,
% whose mean and variance are returned. Note that in cases where the covariance
% function has noise contributions, the variance returned in S2 is for noisy
% test targets; if you want the variance of the noise-free latent function, you
% must substract the noise variance.
%
% usage: [nlml dnlml] = gpr(logtheta, covfunc, x, y)
%    or: [mu S2]  = gpr(logtheta, covfunc, x, y, xstar)
%
% where:
%
%   logtheta is a (column) vector of log hyperparameters
%   covfunc  is the covariance function
%   x        is a n by D matrix of training inputs
%   y        is a (column) vector (of size n) of targets
%   xstar    is a nn by D matrix of test inputs
%   nlml     is the returned value of the negative log marginal likelihood
%   dnlml    is a (column) vector of partial derivatives of the negative
%                 log marginal likelihood wrt each log hyperparameter
%   mu       is a (column) vector (of size nn) of prediced means
%   S2       is a (column) vector (of size nn) of predicted variances

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% In order to incorporate derivative observations, the following modifications
% are made.
% input added:
%   xd	     is a nd by D matrix of training inputs at which derivative
%		observations are available.
%   dy	     is a column vector of ndxD by 1 of derivatives at xd.
%   idx	     is a subvector of [1:D], determining the dimensions of x 
%	       along which derivative observations are available.
%
% input deleted:
%   covfunc is fixed to covSEard + covNoise
%
% usage:
%   [nlml dnlml] = gpr_dob(logtheta, x, y, xd, dy)
%   [mu S2]  = gpr_dob(logtheta, x, y, xd, dy, xstar)
%   [mu S2 dmu_dxstar dS2_dxstar] = gpr_dob(logtheta, x, y, xd, dy, xstar)
%
% output added:
%   dmu_dxstar	is a Dx1 (column) vector of the derivative of mu w.r.t. xstar.
%   dS2_dxstar	is a DxDxD matrix of the derivative of S2 w.r.t. xstar.
%
% Additionally, this program requires two covariance function files
% 'covSEardN_dob_dy.m' and 'covSEardN_dob_y.m' which implement the covariance
% function and its gradient w.r.t. the hyper-parameters.
%
% This program is not optimised in its performance, thus may be slow.
